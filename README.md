# CakeHouse

This app is an implementation of website that allows users to share, discover and vote for their favourite recipes. 
My goal was to learn how to build such app from end to end using popular technologies
such as Spring, React and Docker.

## How to run this app

Requirements:
  - Installed docker

Instructions:
  1. Clone the project using ```https://github.com/KaHarlacz/CakeHouse.git```
  2. Change directory using ```cd CakeHouse```
  3. Run command ```./run.sh```

Notes:
  - At the beginning docker may print some errors if app hasn't been run on your computer yet.
  - Spring boot container may fail if mysql is not ready. In such case backend will be restarted automatically.
